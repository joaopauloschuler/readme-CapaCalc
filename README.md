# CapaCalc

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

This program calculates the **electrical capacitance** of a variety of **conductor arrangements**:

* **Parallel plate** capacitor
* **Spherical** capacitor
* **Cylindrical** capacitor
* Capacitance between **rectangular conductor** and conducting **plane**
* Capacitance between **cylindrical conductor** and conducting **plane**
* Capacitance between **two cylinders**

Moreover, the program calculates the 
* effective capacitance of **capacitors in series** and **in parallel**, as well as the 
* capacitance of a **semiconductor p/n junction**.

## Compilation ##
The application is distributed as Pascal source code only. It can be compiled with Lazarus v2.0+/FPC3.0+ (or even older, not tested). 
No third-party components are needed.

Tested on Windows 32bit/64 bit and Linux 64 bit, but it should work also on other platforms supported by Lazarus.
