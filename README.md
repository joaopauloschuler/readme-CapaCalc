# CapaCalc

![screenshot: screenshot.png]

This program calculates the electrical capacitance of a variety of conductor arrangements:

* Parallel plate capacitor
* Spherical capacitor
* Cylindrical capacitor
* Rectangular conductor and conducting plane
* Cylindrical conductor and conducting plane
* Capacitance between two cylinders

Moreover, the program calculates the 
* effective capacitance of capacitors in series and in parallel, as well as the 
* capacitance of a semiconductor p/n junction.
